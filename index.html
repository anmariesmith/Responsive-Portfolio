        <p>Born in Omaha, Nebraska to a wonderful mother, Carmen Sirizzotti- I was the last arrival of the three
            children. Preceded by 2 boys, I gained a competive disposition and inquisitve mind. I always wanted to know
            how things worked and why they worked. At the tender age of 16, I moved to Georgia</p>
        <p>I finished school at 18 with a strong GPA and plans to go to Georgia Tech. Life, as it always seems, had
            other plans. I excused myself from college to figure out what I really wanted. I took a long time, a really
            long time, to think about that. Finally, nearly 10 years later, I decided what I wanted to do. Coding and
            web development excited me in a way I'd never felt before. I looked into courses and found one at Georgia
            Tech that seems reputable.</p>
        <p>I decided to quit my job, and give this course my full attention. I'm excited/petrified for what is ahead. I
            personally love the adrenaline rush I get from the simplest amount of code I've been able to achieve/create
            thus far-- I can't imagine how I will feel in 12 weeks.</p>
        <p>I didn't realize how long this had to be so here are some fun facts about me:
            <ul>
                <li>I love animals</li>
                <li>I am super type A. Everything in my house has some type of organized system.</li>
                <li>In my spare time, I own and operate a photography business where my husband/partner and I capture
                    various events</li>
                <li>My favorite snack is apples & peanut butter.</li>
            </ul>
